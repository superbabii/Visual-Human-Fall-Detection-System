## Introduction

The Visual Human Fall Detection System is designed to detect falls using visual data. This system can be used in various applications, such as monitoring the elderly or enhancing workplace safety.

## Features

- Pre-trained model for fall detection (`best.pt`).
- Jupyter Notebook implementation (`Fall_detection.ipynb`).
- Custom dataset configuration (`custom_data.yaml`).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/superbabii/Visual-Human-Fall-Detection-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Visual-Human-Fall-Detection-System
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Fall_detection.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the cells in the notebook to load the model and run fall detection on your dataset.

## Customization

To use your own dataset, modify the `custom_data.yaml` file according to your dataset's structure.
